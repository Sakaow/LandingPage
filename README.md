# Landing Page Project

This project requires you to rebuild a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Instructions

This starter project is provided by Udacity that has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. Convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarity the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.ja` and start building out the app's functionality.
